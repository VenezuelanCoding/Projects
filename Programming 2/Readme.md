# Programming 2
In this folder you will find two projects:
## Console Games
This project is about a Java console app that allows the user to play games and saves scores (the data is not persistant, if the programm is terminated the data will be deleted).
The games are really simple and are explained in the system.
## Basic ERP
This is a basic ERP to manage a restaurant orders and save different categories and products. In this case, this system allows data persitance, with a save button that creates a text file
with all the data. So when you start the programm let's you load the save or not.
