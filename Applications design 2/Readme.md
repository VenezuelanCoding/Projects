 # Applications design 2
 This project is about a blog web app writen in Angular, and that consumes an APIRest. The only problem here is because of different problems with 
 the people in charge of this subject, the time was not enough to fix all the bugs. Still, the app can be deployed and used, but the moderation system is really
 unstable when it comes to notifications related to them. Since the project is to big, I'm working on a way to upload everything here.
